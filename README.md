# Practice Create PT

### Part 1: Getting Started
1. Generate 3 project ideas. Each idea should be a website that uses flask and saves data.
1. In cs50 ide, make a new directory. Copy some files from `froshims` (or your adaptation of it) into your new directory as a starting point. Start building one of your ideas (spend roughly 30 minutes on this part). "start building" = put some text and buttons on webpage and think about what routes you need to create in flask.
1. Go back to the google classroom and complete the assignment reflection.

### Part 2: ... coming soon ..
